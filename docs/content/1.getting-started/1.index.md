description: Welcome to Nuxt OIDC Auth
---

Welcome to __Nuxt OIDC Auth__, a Nuxt module focusing on native OIDC (OpenID Connect) based authentication for Nuxt with a high level of customizability and security for SSR applications.
This module doesn't use any external dependencies outside of the [unjs](https://unjs.io/) ecosystem except for token validation (the well known and tested `jose` library for JWT interactions).
This module's session implementation is based on [nuxt-auth-utils](https://github.com/Atinux/nuxt-auth-utils).

## Nuxt OIDC Auth Features

### üîí&nbsp; Secure

- Session expiration check based on token expiration
- Automatic session renewal based on token expiration and refresh tokens
- Secured & sealed cookies sessions
- Access and ID token cryptographic validation (if supported by provider)
- Encrypted server side refresh/access token storage powered Nitro storage layer

### ‚öôÔ∏è&nbsp; Nuxt integrated

- Global middleware with automatic redirection to default provider or custom login page
- `useOidcAuth` composable for getting the user information, logging in and out, refetching the current session and triggering a token refresh
- Server side session and middleware integration

### üìù&nbsp; Compatible

- Generic spec compatible OpenID connect provider with fully configurable OIDC flow (state, nonce, PKCE, token request, ...)
- Presets for [popular OIDC providers](/provider)
- Multi provider support with auto registered routes (`/auth/<provider>/login`, `/auth/<provider>/logout`, `/auth/<provider>/callback`)

## Recent breaking changes

Since 0.16.0, the data from the providers userInfo endpoint is written into `userInfo` on the user object instead of `providerInfo`.
Please adjust your `nuxt.config.ts` and .env/environment files and configurations accordingly.
If you are using the user object from the `useOidcAuth` composable change the access to `providerInfo` to `userInfo`.
