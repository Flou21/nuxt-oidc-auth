## Hooks

The following hooks are available to extend the default behavior of the OIDC module:

- `fetch` (Called when a user session is fetched)
- `clear` (Called before a user session is cleared)
- `refresh` (Called before a user session is refreshed)

Remember to also update the refresh hook if you modify the session, as claims and other fields would otherwise be wiped.

#### Example

```ts
export default defineNitroPlugin(() => {
  sessionHooks.hook('fetch', async (session) => {
    // Extend User Session
    // Or throw createError({ ... }) if session is invalid
    // session.extended = {
    //   fromHooks: true
    // }
    console.log('Injecting "status" claim as test')
    if (!(Object.keys(session).length === 0)) {
      const claimToAdd = { status: 'Fetch' }
      session.claims = { ...session.claims, ...claimToAdd }
    }
  })

  sessionHooks.hook('refresh', async (session) => {
    console.log('Injecting "status" claim as test on refresh')
    if (!(Object.keys(session).length === 0)) {
      const claimToAdd = { status: 'Refresh' }
      session.claims = { ...session.claims, ...claimToAdd }
    }
  })

  sessionHooks.hook('clear', async (session) => {
    // Log that user logged out
    console.log('User logged out')
  })
})
```

You can theoretically register a hook that overwrites internal session fields like `loggedInAt`, but this is not recommended as it has an impact on the `loggedIn` state of your session. It will not impact the server side refresh and expiration logic, but will be overwritten with each refresh.
