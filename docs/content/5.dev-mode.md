## Dev mode

Since 0.10.0, there is a local dev mode available. It can only be enabled if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is not set to `prod/production` AND dev mode is explicitly enabled in the config. The dev mode is for ***local*** and ***offline*** development and returns a static user object that can be configured in the config or by variables in `.env`.
The following fields in the returned [user object](/composable#user-object) can be configured:

- `claims`: `devMode.claims` setting
- `provider`: `devMode.provider` setting
- `userName`: `devMode.userName` setting
- `userInfo`: `devMode.userInfo` setting
- `idToken`: `devMode.idToken` setting
- `accessToken`: `devMode.accessToken` setting

Please refer to [user object](/composable#user-object) for required types.

### Enabling

To enable the dev mode, you have to make sure at least the following settings are set:

- `session` -> `expirationCheck` needs to be turned off (`false`)
- `devMode` -> `enabled` set to `true` in the `oidc` part of your `nuxt.config.ts`

### Token generation

If needed, the dev mode can generate a valid signed access token if the settting `devMode` -> `generateAccessToken` is set to `true`. This token will be exposed in the `user.accessToken` property.
The properties on the generated token are

- `iat` (issued at): current DateTime,
- `iss` (issuer): `devMode.issuer` setting, default `nuxt:oidc:auth:issuer`
- `aud`: `devMode.audience` setting, default `nuxt:oidc:auth:audience`
- `sub`: `devMode.subject` setting, default `nuxt:oidc:auth:subject`
- `exp`: current DateTime + 24h

The access token will be generated with a fixed local secret and can in no way be considered secure. Dev mode can only be enabled in local development and should exclusively be used there for testing purposes. Never set any environment variables on your production systems that could put any component into development mode.
